# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data using Stanford's Sentiment140 Dataset

Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data using Stanford's Sentiment140 Dataset I spearheaded a robust project in collaboration with Stanford's renowned Sentiment140 dataset, comprising 1.6 million annotated tweets. 

The project's primary objective was to discern sentiment within social media conversations, employing a multifaceted approach

Key Achievements:

- ðŸ’¡Data Refinement and Cleaning: I strategically reduced the dataset to 1/4th of its original size and meticulously cleaned it using Word Tokenizer. This process eliminated HTML decoding, URL links, Mentions, Hashtags, and eradicated extraneous white spaces, ensuring high-quality data for analysis.
- ðŸ”ŽText Visualization with Wordcloud: Leveraged Wordcloud for vivid text representation, visually depicting positive and negative tweet content, offering insightful glimpses into sentiment trends.
- ðŸ“ˆStatistical Insights: Employed statistical methodologies such as Zipf's Law to uncover the distribution of tweet tokens. Analyzed the top 50 tokens in negative and positive tweets, showcasing their frequency and significance within each sentiment category.
- ðŸ“ŠProbability Statistics and Visualizations: Computed Probability Statistics like 'posrate' and presented Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) plots, highlighting the comparative distribution between positive and negative tweets.
- ðŸ¤–Model Development and Evaluation: Splitting the refined dataset, I used TextBlob sentiment analysis as the baseline. Employed CountVectorizer and TF-IDF for feature extraction coupled with Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Multinomial NB, and Bernoulli NB models to classify sentiment using unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams.ðŸš€
